# Brewery Finder Final Capstone Project

The site was designed to show information about breweries and beers. Beer lovers can search and view information about their favorite breweries and beers.

As a Beer Lover I can view a location that is in the system.

## When I view the location, I am able to see the following:
* Name    
* Location
* Bar or Brewery
* Image
* Established
* Background
* List of Beers Offered
* Name
* Description
* Image
* ABV
* Beer Type

## Search Breweries
 As a user, I can search for breweries using the following criteria:

* name
* location
* happy hour hours
* brewery or bar or both

## Login
As a beer lover, I can “log in” to the system so that I can access functionality that isn’t available to me as an anonymous user.

## Registration
As a Beer Lover I can register for the site so that I can favorite beers that I've had.

## Favorite
As a user that has logged in, I can favorite a beer so that I can come back and see which beers I have enjoyed the most.
