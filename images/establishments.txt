When we conceived of Brewnuts it was always with donuts and beer having a seat at the table. We’ve known from the jump that we were setting out to be a Donut Bar and unlike any other donut shop we’d ever seen. Thanks in large part to our collaborative relationship with Cleveland’s brewery scene, we regularly carry sixteen carefully selected local brews on tap which is complimented by a robust bottle and can program.
